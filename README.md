The team analyzed the pre-pandemic retail sales and the total consumers in the Midwest to
predict up to 10 years for retail and food sales and the Total Consumers in the Midwest. During
the pandemic, we noticed that there was some food shortage and an increase in retail goods.
This would allow our end users to be able to visualize and comprehend the future trends which
enables for planning as well as preparing ahead of time for the upcoming years and months.

Project Objectives:
The US Census Bureau provides basic dashboards targeting the monthly sales by kind of
business for retail and food service. Our dashboard aimed at providing a holistic insight to the
retailers enabling them to make better decisions about stock ordering, inventory management,
hiring the personnel etc. Making accurate forecasts about the future sales was also made easier
with our dashboard application. The goal of the project is to target the retailers in the US by
providing a dashboard which will provide accurate information on the current sales-specific
data.
Project Usefulness:
Our dashboard application can be particularly useful as it provides a concise visual
representation of the sales-specific data to augment the team's understanding and save their
time interpreting it.
The dashboard application can be useful in the following ways:
Analyzing the data of 17 years aids in making better decisions about ordering the stock as per
the requirement, staffing etc.
- Inventory: The dashboard helps to display inventory reports to the owners. This not only
helps them get an idea of their product units but also the current stock value. Such
reports help the owners to get a brief idea of the capital left in their inventories and
help them to plan their finances accordingly.
- Product performance report: It helps to give an estimate of the amount of merchandise
an owner sells over a particular period. It also helps them to understand which products
are being sold at a fast rate and which products are not worth re-ordering.
- Sales summary: The summary report helps the owners gain insights into retail on a
macro level.
